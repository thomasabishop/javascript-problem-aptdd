### My answers to the problem

* Question One: `2020-01-01T00:15:00.000Z` 
* Question Two: `2020-01-01T19:15:00.000Z`

I failed to complete Question Three. I have explained the approach I attempted and where I ran into difficulty in the file [question-three-attempt](https://github.com/thomasabishop/javascript-problem-aptdd/blob/master/question-three-attempt.md).

The main file is `index.js`. It imports functions defined in `src/functionLibrary.js`

### Running the code

My attempted solution uses Node.js as the runtime. 

```
// Git clone etc
npm install
npm start
```

### Running the tests 

```
npm run test
```
